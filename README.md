# OasisPlanner 
_Calendar App Project_ (Developing Phase)

## Our Goals

Oasis: where you find calm _in the past, present, and future._

We aim to provide a convenient and simple interface for users to effortlessly jot down and analyze their everyday productive work, without putting too much stress on yourself. 

We believe:
- Visualizing past work done can improve confidence
- Striking a balance between work and relaxing is crucial to boosting long-term productivity

## Code Maintenance
_Most part of the features are still under development._
- [Design Reference on Code Structure](markdowns/code_structure.md)

## Design
- [Design Document](markdowns/first_draft_design_document.png)
- Note: In the deisgn document, some feature designs are copied from existing apps. Such designs will ONLY BE USED AS A BASIC REFERENCE, and the final product WILL NOT include the exact same design.

- We are currently working on:
  - Modularizing our previous code to increase readability
  - Redesigning several components to increase cohesion between UI elements and enhance user experience
